                    <strong>Self-development</strong> and <strong>realization of myself</strong> is my purpose. Of course I want to work in <u>EPAM</u> or other IT company. Also 
                    I hope I can leave my country and enjoy my work. I have some qualities, which will help me to achieve success. For example ability to use my brain, sociability, perseveranse, gumption, and the most importent <u>sense of humor</u>. 
                    I have no work experience, but I feel a great desire to work.  But now, it rests on the looking for myself and a throw into the unknown.
                    I like to learn everything new and most often it comes easy for me.  At the moment, everything I start to do/learn, I succeeded.  A talented person is talented in everything, and that's about me.
                    I enjoy friendly teams and human respect.
