***Self-development*** and ***realization of myself*** is my purpose. Of course I want to work in <u>EPAM</u> or other IT company. Also 
I hope I can leave my country and enjoy my work. I have some qualities, which will help me to achieve success. For example ability to use my brain, sociability, perseveranse, gumption, and the most importent <u>sense of humor</u>. 

I have no work experience, but I feel a great desire to work.  But now, it rests on the looking for myself and a throw into the unknown.

I like to learn everything new and most often it comes easy for me.  At the moment, everything I start to do/learn, I succeeded.  A talented person is talented in everything, and that's about me.

I enjoy friendly atmosphere in team and human respect.

Sample code:
--------------

```
const func = (num) => {  
  if (num > 0) {  
    return num - 1;  
  }
  return num + 1;  
};  
```

Priorities:
--------------------
1. Mental and physical health;

4. Entertainment and hobbies;
5. Time to "be dumb and relax" (this is also important)
